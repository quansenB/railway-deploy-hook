## Usage

### Calling the Webhook

Send a POST request to your webhook endpoint with the required query parameters:

```http
POST https://your-function-subdomain.railway.app/webhook?environmentId=ENVIRONMENT_ID&serviceId=SERVICE_ID
```

#### Parameters

- `environmentId`: The ID of the Railway environment where the service is located
- `serviceId`: The ID of the Railway service to redeploy

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-function-url.railway.app/webhook?environmentId=c3b077f3-feb0-448f-80b4-ccdae37a6fb5&serviceId=952f84ee-e0e7-4c76-92df-88e3cfe52e0d"
```

### Finding Service and Environment IDs

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Select the desired environment
3. Click on the service you want to deploy
4. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "General"
5. You'll find the IDs under "Service ID" and "Environment ID"

### Health Check

Check if your service is running:

```bash
curl https://your-function-url.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## API Responses

### Successful Request

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Service 952f84ee-e0e7-4c76-92df-88e3cfe52e0d redeployed in environment c3b077f3-feb0-448f-80b4-ccdae37a6fb5"
}

## Automation

You can integrate this webhook into various CI/CD pipelines or automation tools:

- **GitHub Actions**: Call the webhook after successful tests
- **Zapier/Make**: Connect with other services
- **Cron Jobs**: Schedule regular deployments
- **Monitoring Tools**: Trigger deployments based on metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized**: Check your `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`
2. **400 Bad Request**: Make sure both query parameters (`environmentId` and `serviceId`) are present
3. **500 Internal Server Error**: Check the logs in your Railway Function

### Viewing Logs

1. Go to your Railway Function
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the current deployment
4. Scroll to the "Logs" to diagnose errors

## Security

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep your `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` secret
- üîí The token has access to your entire Railway account
- üõ°Ô∏è Consider implementing authentication for the webhook endpoint in production environments

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the Railway Function logs
2. Make sure all environment variables are set correctly
3. Verify that the service and environment IDs are correct
